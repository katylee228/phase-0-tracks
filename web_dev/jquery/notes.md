I will look up w3schools.com (http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp) to study jquery. 
I will study from jQuery Tutorial to jQuery HTML.
I will create a project that I can experiment and use most of the functions in the program.


It's written form of resources, but since it has UI that I can experiment on, I believe that it will be very helpful. I will stop and test for every function. 

I realized that it's a better idea to create a big picture that I want to achieve and then check some skills to apply for this project.
